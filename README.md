## 📌 Overview

This project implements **automatic image colorization** using a deep learning model trained on thousands of color photos. Given a black-and-white (grayscale) image, it predicts the appropriate colors and reconstructs a plausible colored image.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Convert black-and-white images to color automatically
- 🧠 Uses pre-trained models for fast and accurate results
- 📷 Support for single or batch image processing
- 🔧 Simple to use via command-line or script
- ⚡ Lightweight and runs locally with OpenCV + NumPy

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Caffe** (for model format)
- *(Optional)*: **PyTorch + DeOldify** for advanced colorization
